\section*{Problem 1: NP, BPP, RP (2 points)}

\subsection*{Question}
Prove that if $\NP \subseteq \BPP$, then $\NP = \RP$.

\emph{Hint: Try using the self-reducibility of $\mathsf{SAT}$.}

\subsection*{Answer}
Say $\NP \subseteq \BPP$.  Then $\text{SAT} \in \BPP$ so there is a ptime probabilistic Turing macine $M$ which decides SAT with probability at least 2/3.
From this we can derive a TM $\bar{M}$ which decides SAT on any formula $\phi$ with probability at least $1 - 2^{-(n + m)}$ where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of clauses in $\phi$.

We can use $\bar{M}$ to produce an RP algorithm for $\text{SAT}$, which will try to produce a satisfying assignment $x_1, \dots, x_n$, then verify that it is correct.
First, construct formula $\phi_1$ by setting $X_1 = 1$ in $\phi$.  Run $\bar{M}$ on $\phi_1$.
If this returns that $\phi_1$ is satisfiable, set $x_1 = 1$; else set $x_1 = 0$.
Now recurse this procedure on $\phi_1$ if $x_1 = 1$, or on $\phi_{\not 1}$ generated by
fixing $X_1 = 0$ in $\phi$ if $x_1 = 0$.
Once the recursion is called on $\phi$ with no variables, if
the resulting variable-free formula reduces to false, return that there is no satisfying
assignment; else return control to the top level of the recursion.
If it ends up producing assignment $x_1, \dots, x_n$, deterministically check that this satisfies $\phi$.  If it does, return true, else, return false.

Observe that if the formula is not satisfiable, this algorithm will never return 1, since the assignment $x_1, \dots, x_n$ which is generated will not satisfy the formula.
Thus, to show that this algorithm puts $\text{SAT}$ in $\RP$, we need to show that if the formula is satisfiable, the algorithm will return 1 with probability at least 2/3.

This algorithm has $n$ recursive calls, and the probability level $i$ assigns a variable incorrectly, or incorrectly states that the formula is unsatisfiable, is at most $2^{-(i + m)}$.
Thus the overall probability something goes wrong is less than or equal to
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n{2^{-(i + m)}} < 2^{-m} < 2/3
$$

This shows that $\text{SAT} \in \RP$, and since $\RP \subseteq \NP$, we have $\NP = \RP$.

\section*{Problem 2: A Tighter Circuit Lower Bound (2 points)}

\subsection*{Question}

We showed in class that for every $k$, there is a function $f_k \in \Sigma_3 \P$ that does not have $k n^k$-size circuits. Use the ideas in the proof of this fact to prove that there is an $\eps > 0$ and a function $f \in \EXP^{(\NP^{\NP})}$ that does not have $\eps 2^n/n$ size circuits.

\subsection*{Answer}
Algorithm $\mathsf{HardFunction}$ below implements a function f so that ``f(x) = g(x), where g is the first function such that there is no circuit of size $\epsilon 2^n/n$ that computes g''.

\begin{algorithm}{$\mathsf{HardFunction}(x : \{0, 1\}^n)$}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Guess $f : \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ (and write it down using $2^n$ bits).
\STATE For all circuits $C$ of size $\epsilon 2^n / n$,
\STATE Guess $z$ of $n$ bits, verify $C(z) = f(z)$ and reject if not.
\STATE Then, for all $h : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$, such that $h < g$ when $h$ and $g$ are represented as bit strings,
\STATE Guess a circuit $D$ of size $\epsilon 2^n / n$.
\STATE For all $z' \in \{0, 1\}^n$ verify that $D(z') = h(z')$.
\STATE Output $g(x)$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Observe that lines 3 and 6 can be implemented in Exponential(n) time.  Also observe that writing down circuits in lines 2 and 5 require $O((\epsilon 2^n / n) \log(\epsilon 2^n / n)) = O(2^n)$ bits.  Thus this algorithm can be run in exponential time with quantification taking an $\exists \forall \forall \exists$ structure (quantification on lines 1, 2, 4, and 5).  So it is in $\EXP^{\Sigma_3 \P}$.
Finally, noting that there exist functions on $n$ inputs with no circuits of size $2^n/(10n)$, we can take $\epsilon = 1/10$ to ensure that this algorithm accepts a nontrivial set of $x$ values.

Now, either $\NP \subseteq \P/\poly$ or $\NP \not\subseteq \P/\poly$.

If $\NP \subseteq \P/\poly$, then by the K-L theorem, $\PH = \Sigma_2 P$, so our function $f \in \EXP^{\Sigma_3 \P}$ actually satisfies $f \in \EXP^{\Sigma_2 P} = \EXP^{(\NP^{\NP})}$.

If $\NP \not\subseteq \P/\poly$, observe that $\text{SAT} \notin \P/\poly$.
This means that for every $k$, infinitely often in $m$, there is a string $\phi \in \{0, 1\}^m$ such that no circuit of size $km^k$ decides $\phi \in \text{SAT}$.  Thus for any $n$, there exists $m \geq 2^n/n$ which can't be solved by any circuit of size $km^k \geq k(2^n/n)^k$ and thus certainly can't be solved by a circuit of size $\epsilon 2^n/n$.  This shows that 


% (each of which can be written using $\epsilon 2^n / n \log(\epsilon 2^n / n) = O(2^n)$ bits)

\section*{Problem 3: P=NP Implies Better Circuit Lower Bounds (3 Points)}

\subsection*{Question}
Prove that if $\P = \NP$ then there is an $\varepsilon > 0$ and $f \in \TIME[2^{O(n)}]$ such that $f \notin \SIZE[\varepsilon 2^n/n]$. 

\subsection*{Answer}

In the previous part, we proved that there exists an $\epsilon$ and a function $f \in \EXP^{(\NP^{\NP})}$ that does not have $\epsilon 2^n/n$ size circuits.

If $\P = \NP$, then $\EXP^{(\NP^{\NP})} = \EXP^{\NP^\P} = \EXP^{\NP} = \EXP^\P = \EXP$.  Thus there exists $f \in \EXP$ (specifically, say, $f \in \textsf{TIME}[2^{kn^k}]$) such that $f$ does not have $\epsilon 2^n/n$ size circuits.

\textbf{TODO}


\newpage
\section*{Problem 4: BPL (3 points)}

\subsection*{Question}
A probabilistic TM is said to work in space $s(n)$ if every branch requires $O(s(n))$ space for inputs of size $n$ and terminates in $2^{O(s(n))}$ time. The machine has \emph{one-way access} to a read-only random tape, i.e. each random bit can only be read once.

Define the class $\BPL$ (for bounded-error probabilistic log-space) as follows: a language $L$ is in $\BPL$ if there exists an $O(\log n)$-space probabilistic TM $M$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $x\in L$, then $\Pr[M(x)\text{ accepts}]\ge 2/3$.
    \item If $x\not\in L$, then $\Pr[M(x)\text{ accepts}]\le 1/3$.
\end{enumerate}
Prove the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $\BPL\subseteq \SPACE[(\log n)^2]$.
    \item[(b)] $\BPL\subseteq \P$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Answer to (a)}

Say M is a log-space probabilistic TM.

Then it uses $c log(n)$ space, and runs in $k^{k log(n)} = n^k$
time.

Given x of size n:

For every string y of length $n^k$, run M on (x, y).
Count the number of acceptances.

Return true if most of the runs accepted.

We need to track:

1. The current string y (k log(n) bits)

2. The number of acceptances (k log(n) bits)

3. Space for the current run of M (c log(n) bits).

Altogether this is O(log(n)) bits.

If this is true, then $\BPL \subseteq \textsf{SPACE}[log(n)] \subseteq \P$, solving both (a) and (b).

\textbf{Is this wrong somehow?}








\subsection*{Answer to (b)}



\newpage
\section*{Problem 5: Advice Removal (2 points)}

Assume $s : \N \rightarrow \N$ is a time constructible function. Recall $\mathsf{P}/s(n)$ is the class of languages decidable by a polynomial time algorithm with $s(n)$ advice. 

Prove that if $\textsf{SAT} \in \mathsf{P}/s(n)$ then $\textsf{SAT}$ can be solved in $2^{O(s(n))}\cdot \poly(n)$ time. That is, there is an algorithm running in $2^{O(s(n))}\cdot \poly(n)$ time which, given any formula $\phi$ of size $n$, outputs a satisfying assignment to $\phi$ when one exists.

(This result is interesting, in part because it is a major open problem whether $\textsf{SAT} \in \mathsf{P}/\mathsf{poly}$ implies $\P = \NP$ or not!)

\emph{Hint: Try using the self-reducibility of $\mathsf{SAT}$.}

\newpage
\section*{Problem 6: Pairwise Independence (6 Points, 2 for each sub-problem)}  

In this problem, we will show how to generate ``pseudo-random bits'' with a nice property. These are sometimes useful for derandomizing algorithms. We will use them to prove other theorems in the class.

A set of discrete random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3, \ldots, X_n$ is {\em pairwise independent} if for every $i \neq j$,
\[\Pr[ X_i = a \mid X_j = b ] = \Pr[ X_i = a]\] for every $a,b$ in the range of the variables.
$X_i$ is {\em unbiased} if each element of the range of $X_i$ is equally likely.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[(a)] {\bf Generating Pairwise Independent Bits.} Let $V_n$ be the set of all $n$-bit vectors excluding the all-$0$ vector. For every $v \in V_n$,
define $X_v (r) = \langle v, r \rangle$ where $r$ is any $n$-bit vector and $\langle,\rangle$ is inner product modulo $2$. Picking $r$ uniformly at random, the $X_v$'s are well-defined random variables. \\
{\bf Show that the $X_v$'s are unbiased and pairwise independent.} 

Note we use $n$ random bits to select $r$, and obtain $2^n - 1$ pairwise independent bits $X_v$! (One can think of the above process as a ``pairwise independent" pseudorandom generator that takes an $n$-bit seed and produces $2^n-1$ bits.)
Also note if we include the all-$0$ vector in $V_n$, we would lose the unbiased property, but the $X_i$'s would still be pairwise independent. \end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)] {\bf Pairwise Independent Hashing.} Let $p$ be prime and $\F_p$ be the field of integers modulo $p$. For $a, b$ independently
and uniformly chosen at random from $\F_p$, let $Y_i = a\cdot i+b $.\\
{\bf  Show that $\{Y_i \mid i\in \F_p \}$ are unbiased and pairwise independent.}

{\em Hint: For any fixed values $Y_i$ and $Y_j$, the equations $Y_i = ai+b $ and $Y_j = aj+b $ can be uniquely solved for $a$ and $b$.}  \end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)] We will work over $\F_2$. Let $V_n$ be the set of all $n$-bit vectors excluding the all-$0$ vector. 
Letting $M$ be a uniformly randomly chosen Boolean $m \times n$ matrix, define the random variable $X_v = Mv$. \\
{\bf Show that the $X_v$'s are unbiased and pairwise independent.}

Define the function family $f_M (v) = Mv$, as we vary over all matrices $M$. \\
{\bf Show for all $v \neq v'$, when we pick a function $f$ uniformly at random from this
family, $\Pr_f[ f(v)=a \wedge f(v')=b]$ is the same for all $a$ and $b$.}

Such a family of functions is called a {\em pairwise independent family of hash
functions}. They are very useful! 
\end{enumerate}
