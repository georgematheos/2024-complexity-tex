\section*{Problem 1: Circuit Lower Bounds from Pseudorandom Generators (3 Points)}

\subsection*{Question}
We showed that circuit lower bound implied ``good'' PRGs. Here is a sort-of converse:

Show that if there is a $O(\log(n))$-seed 1/10-pseudorandom generator computable in $2^{O(m)}$ time on $m$-bit seeds, then there is an $\eps>0$ such that $\DTIME[2^{O(n)}]\not\subset\SIZE[2^{\eps n}]$.

\subsection*{Answer}
\textbf{TODO: clean this up!  Currently messy enough there is a small chance my approach doesn't work.}

Say there exists such a pseudorandom generator $g : \{0, 1\}* \to \{0, 1\}*$ computed
by Turing machine $G$ running in $2^{km + l}$ time.
WLOG, say that for all $n$, $|x| = c \log(n) \implies |g(x)| = n$.
For any circuit $C$ of size $n$,
$$
|Pr_{x \in \{0, 1\}^{c \log(n)}}[C(g(x)) = 1] - Pr_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n}[C(x) = 1] | < 1/10
$$

The idea is going to be that in time $2^m \times 2^{km} = 2^{(k+1)m}$, a Turing machine can run $g$ on every length $m$ string, and compute $Pr_{x \in \{0, 1\}^{c \log(n)}}[C(g(x)) = 1]$ exactly, but no circuit of size $2^m$ can do this.

% Fix a sufficiently large $n$, and let $x^* \in \{0, 1\}^{c \log(n) + 1}$ such that $$x^* \notin \{g(y) : y \in \{0, 1\}^{c \log(n)}\}$$

Consider the decision problem $f : \{0, 1\}^* \to \{0, 1\}$ where
$$
f(x) = 1 \iff \exists y \in \{0, 1\}^{|x| - 1} \text{ s.t. } g(y) = x \qquad (*)
$$
Suppose for contradiction that $f \in \SIZE[2^n]$.
Let $C$ be the circuit of size $2^n$ that decides this for a given $n$.
Say $m = cn$ (so $m = c\log(2^n)$).
Observe
$$
Pr_{y \in \{0, 1\}^m}[C(g(y)_{1:m+1}) = 1] = 1
$$
Here, $g(y)_{1:m+1}$ is the first $m+1$ bits of $g(y)$.

However, 
$$
Pr_{x \in \{0, 1\}^{2^n}}[C(x_{1:m+1}) = 1] \leq 1/2
$$
because only half of the $m+1$ bit strings can be in the range of a function with domain $\{0, 1\}^m$.
This contradicts $(*)$.
Thus $f \notin \SIZE[2^n]$.
But certainly $f \in \DTIME[2^{O(n)}]$, because it is possible to loop over all $2^n$ $y$ values of length $n$, and for each one check if $x = g(y)$ in time $2^{O(n)}$.  This yields an algorithm for deciding $f$ with total runtime $2^n 2^{O(n)} = 2^{O(n) + n} = 2^{O(n)}$.

% Here, $C$ is the description of a circuit of size $2^m$, and $m$ and $s$ are integers.

\section*{Problem 2: Randomized Approximate Counting with an NP Oracle (12 pts, 3 for each sub-problem)}

\subsection*{Question}

We will develop a real-life application of SAT solvers.
{\bf Assume $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{NP}$ in this question.} Let $H_{n,k}$ be a pairwise independent hash family of functions from $\{0,1\}^n$ to $\{0,1\}^k$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Prove that there is a constant $p \in (0,1)$ and a constant $\eps > 0$ such that for every $k$ and  $S \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, 
	
	\begin{itemize} 
	\item[$\bullet$] if $|S| \leq 2^{k-2}$, then \[\Pr_{h \in H_{n,k}}[\text{there is an $x \in S$ such that $h(x) = 0^k$}] < p - \eps,\] and
	\item[$\bullet$] if $|S| \geq 2^{k-1}$, then \[\Pr_{h \in H_{n,k}}[\text{there is an $x \in S$ such that $h(x) = 0^k$}] > p + \eps.\] 
\end{itemize}
		\item[(b)]
		Use part (a) to show that that there is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that approximates \#\textsf{SAT} within a factor of 4. More precisely, there is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that given any Boolean formula $F$ outputs a number $K$ such that $\#\textsf{SAT}(F)/2 \leq K \leq 2\cdot \left(\#\textsf{SAT}(F)\right)$.
	\item[(c)]
	Show that for any constant $\varepsilon>0$, there is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that approximates $\#\textsf{SAT}$ within a factor of $1+\varepsilon$. (Hint: Try to modify the given formula $F$ in some natural way that changes the number of SAT assignments, then feed the modification to your algorithm from part (b).)
	\item[(d)]
		Show that you can derandomize the algorithm.	That is, prove that if $\P = \NP$ then for every function $f\in \#\mathbf{P}$, and any constant $\varepsilon>0$, there is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that approximates $f$ within a factor of $1+\varepsilon$. (Warning: the approximate counting problem is \emph{not} a decision problem, so you cannot just ``plug in'' $\P = \NP$ here\dots)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 3: Constant Round Arthur-Merlin Collapses (3 points)}

Prove that for every fixed positive integer $k$, $\AM[k]\subseteq \AM[2]$.

\medskip

\emph{Hint: Try error-reduction, to make the probability of error very small.}


\section*{Problem 4: AM Protocol for Set Lower Bound (6 Points, 2 for each sub-problem)}

In this problem, we will develop an $\AM$ protocol for proving a set lower bound, which is used as a subroutine in the $\AM$ protocol for graph non-isomorphism. In a set lower bound protocol, the prover needs to prove to the verifier that given a (large) set $S\subseteq \{0,1\}^m$ (where membership in $S$ is efficiently verifiable), $S$ has cardinality at least $K$, up to a factor of $2$. More precisely, given any $K$,
\begin{itemize}
\item  if $|S| \ge K$ then the prover can make the verifier accept with high probability; 
\item if $|S| < K/2$ then the verifier rejects with high probability regardless of what the prover does.
\end{itemize}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Let $H_{m,k}$ be a pairwise independent hash family of functions from $\{0,1\}^m$ to $\{0,1\}^k$. Use the pairwise independent hash family $H_{m,k}$ to give a $2$-round $\AM$ protocol for the set lower bound problem described above.
    
    \item[(b)] Show that there exists an $\AM$ protocol for set lower bound with perfect completeness.

    \emph{Hint: Consider the case where the prover uses multiple hash functions $h_1,\dots, h_n$ so that $\bigcup_{i = 1}^n h_i(S) = \{0,1\}^k$.}
    
    \item[(c)] Generalize the idea from part (b) to show that every problem in $\MA$ has a protocol with perfect completeness. Namely, show that for every language $L\in \MA$, there exists a probabilistic polynomial time verifier $V$ such that 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[-] If $x\in L$, then there exists $m$ such that $\Pr_r[V(x,r,m) = 1] = 1$.
        \item[-] If $x\not\in L$, then for all $m$, $\Pr_r[V(x,r,m)]\le 1/3$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}



\section*{Problem 5: The Limits of PCPs (4 Points, 2 for each sub-problem)}
Recall that in class we defined $\mf{PCP}_s[r(n),q(n)]$ to be the set of functions with probabilistically checkable proofs having ``soundness'' $s$. In general, we can parametrize the ``completeness'' as well. 

Specifically, define $f:\{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ to be in $\mf{PCP}_{c,s}[r(n),q(n)]$ if there is a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm $V$ such that for all $x$, $V$ uses $O(r(|x|))$ random bits, asks $q(|x|)$ oracle queries to a proof string $P$ non-adaptively, must decide whether accept or reject, and
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	$f(x) = 1 \Longrightarrow$ there is a $P$ such that $\Pr[V^P(x) \textrm{ accepts}] \geq c$.
	\item
	$f(x) = 0 \Longrightarrow$ for all $P$, $\Pr[V^P(x) \textrm{ accepts}] < s$.
\end{itemize}

Note that in this generalized version, when $f(x) = 1$, we do not require the verifier to accept with probability $1$ on some proof $P$. 

In the PCP lectures, it was proved that $\mf{PCP}_{1,1}(\log n, 3)=\mathbf{NP}$. The number $3$ here is actually the smallest possible. In this problem, you are asked to show that if we reduce the number of queries to two or one, the classes become $\mathbf{P}$. Prove that:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item
	for every $0<s\leq  c\leq 1$, $\mf{PCP}_{c,s}(\log n,1)=\mathbf{P}$.
	\item
	for every $0<s\leq 1$, $\mf{PCP}_{1,s}(\log n,2)=\mathbf{P}$.
\end{enumerate} 
\emph{Hint: Think about these 1-query and 2-query PCPs from the CSP/inapproximability perspective: what you want to show is that the resulting CSPs are in fact easy to solve.}

\smallskip

{\bf Extra credit:} Prove that for every $0<s\leq 1$, $\bigcup_{k \geq 1} \mf{PCP}_{1,s}(n^k,2) \subseteq \mf{PSPACE}$

\smallskip

\emph{Hint: Use the fact that 2SAT is in NL.}
